# Airtable Automation Scripts
Airtable scripting allows you to write short scripts to automate repetitive tasks. This repository has scripts that will save you time by automating the following:

- [Airtime & Data Recharges](https://github.com/ikapadata/Airtable/tree/new-edits/Airtime%20%26%20Data%20Distribution)
- [SMS Notifications](https://github.com/ikapadata/Airtable/tree/new-edits/SMS%20Notificamtions)

To use the scripts above you only have to copy the code from the javascript files and paste it onto the Airtable Scripting block and add the relevant Tables and parameters. To edit the scripts, you'll need a basic understanding of JavaScript. To familiarise or refresh your knowledge on JavaScript read the resources below.
