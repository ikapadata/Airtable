# Airtable Automation Scripts
Airtable scripting allows you to write short scripts to automate repetitive tasks. This repository has scripts that will save you time by automating the following:

- [Airtime & Data Recharges](https://github.com/ikapadata/Airtable/tree/new-edits/Airtime%20%26%20Data%20Distribution)
- [SMS Distribution](https://github.com/ikapadata/Airtable/tree/new-edits/SMS%20Notificamtions)

To use the scripts above you only have to copy and paste the code in javascript files into the Airtable Scripting block and add the relevant Tables and parameters. To edit the scripts, you'll need a basic understanding of JavaScript.
